h3. Version 3.3.3
* Update amqp-client to version 3.6.6. ([#83|http://github.com/budjb/grails-rabbitmq-native/issues/83])

h3. Version 3.3.2
* Fix message converter/consumer handler issue where message handler methods with primitive types\
  (such as @int@) would not accept the equivalent boxed type (such as @Integer@).

h3. Version 3.3.1
* Reintroduce support for consumer handler methods taking only the @MessageContext@ as a parameter.

h3. Version 3.3.0
{warning}
This version includes changes to the configuration format introduced in 3.2.0. There were issues with YAML configuration
and using the keys as the names of connection, queues, or exchanges where those names had periods in them. There was
no way to escape them, and it broke the configuration parsing code. Due to this, the format had to change. This
decision was not made lightly and I intend on this being the last change to the configuration format.
{warning}
* Changed the configuration format introduced in 3.2.0. This breaks backward compatibility with that version.

h3. Version 3.2.0
{note}A huge thanks to [Ollie Freeman|https://github.com/olliefreeman] for his work on this release.{note}
* First non-beta release of the plugin for Grails 3.
* Deprecate closure-based queue/exchange configuration.
* Add new map-based configuration that works well with YAML.
* Removed @RabbitMessageBuilder@.

{note}
All versions below refer to the Grails 2.x plugin. The Grails 3.x plugin forked from the Grails 2.x version after
release 3.1.3.
