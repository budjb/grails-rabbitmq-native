A direct exchange will forward messages to queues based on binding criteria configured similarly to topic exchanges. 
The difference in this case is that direct routing does not utilize wildcards in their routing keys.

package com.example

class ExampleConsumer {
    static rabbitConfig = [
        "exchange": "direct.exchange",
        "binding": "example"

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Process message
    }
}
