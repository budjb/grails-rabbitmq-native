==== Basic Usage

In its most basic form, a message handler method takes in the body of the received message, and a @MessageContext@
object that contains the message parameters received from the RabbitMQ server, along with the consumer's channel
that the handler should publish messages through.

This is the most generic form of a message handler:

[source,groovy]
-----
package com.example

import com.budjb.rabbitmq.consumer.MessageContext

class ExampleConsumer {
    // ...

    def handleMessage(def body, MessageContext context) {
        // Do work
    }
}
