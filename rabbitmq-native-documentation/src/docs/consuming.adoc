== Consuming Messages

Consuming messages is accomplished by creating a message consumer class. Consumer classes are placed into the
`grails-app/rabbit-consumers`, and must end with `Consumer.groovy`. These classes are Spring beans, meaning
that they can inject other Spring beans such as services, the `grailsApplication` instance, etc. Each consumer
class must be configured in a certain way. If there is a misconfiguration in a consumer, the plugin will log
an error stating so and not register the consumer to any queues.
