=== Transactions

The plugin provides a bit of automation around channel transactions. When a consumer is defined with the `transacted` property set to `true`, a transaction is automatically started on
the channel passed to the message handler. When the message handler completes successfully, the transaction is automatically committed. If an unhandled exception is thrown from the message
handler, the transaction is automatically rolled back.

It is *especially important* that any messages published from a message handler use the `Channel` instance passed in the `MessageContext` for this functionality to work.

Since the `Channel` is passed in the `MessageContext`, the author has full control over committing and rolling back transactions.
