Subscribing to a exchanges is different from subscribing to queues, as there are different types of exchanges with different behavior.
RabbitMQ's libraries do not provide a direct way to subscribe to an exchange, however the plugin provides a way to subscribe to exchanges directly by creating
a temporary queue that is bound to an exchange. The binding requirements differ between the different types of exchanges.

{warning}
Using the functionality to subscribe to an exchange works by creating a temporary queue at runtime that is bound to the exchange and consumed from by
the message consumer.  It is important to note that these queues are randomly named and are exclusive and auto delete, so this feature is not
suitable if messages that are left on this queue should persist if the application shuts down.
