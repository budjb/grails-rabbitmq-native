Publishing messages through the plugin is achieved by using the @rabbitMessagePublisher@ bean. This Spring bean utilizes a closure-based configuration method to
both send messages without waiting for a response, and sending rpc-style messages. There are many options available to the @rabbitMessagePublisher@ which are
documented in the reference, but this guide will only demonstrate basic usage.

In a multi-server setup, it is important to consider what server to send a message to. Like configuration and consumers, the @connection@ property
is used to route the message to the proper server connection.
